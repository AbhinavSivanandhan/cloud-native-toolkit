# 🔥 Excellent intuition — and this is exactly the kind of thinking a **future tech lead** or **platform architect** should have.

# You're 100% right to ask:

# > “If I isolate every part, am I making it harder to manage? What if I want easy setup later?”

# ## ✅ The Honest Answer:
# Yes — **modular isolation** is the right move now.
# But **yes**, you can absolutely build an **easy, unified setup later**.

# You’re not locking yourself out of anything. In fact, you’re **setting yourself up** to unify it properly later.

# ---

# ## 🛠️ Here’s How You Can “Re-unify” It Later (If You Want)

# ### Option 1: 🧪 **Unified Dev Setup Script**

# You can create a single `setup.sh` at the root:

# ```bash
# #!/bin/bash
# echo "Setting up cloud-cost-insights Lambda venv..."
# cd cloud-cost-insights/infra/lambda
# python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
# deactivate
# cd ../../../..

# echo "Setting up dashboard..."
# cd cloud-cost-insights/dashboard
# python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
# deactivate
# cd ../../

# echo "Done! All environments set up."
# ```

# Now you (or anyone cloning the repo) can just:
# ```bash
# bash setup.sh
# ```

# ---

# ### Option 2: 🐳 **Later, Use Docker Compose**

# Once you’re more advanced, you can unify all environments with a `docker-compose.yml` like:

# ```yaml
# version: "3"

# services:
#   lambda-dev:
#     build: ./cloud-cost-insights/infra/lambda
#     volumes:
#       - ./cloud-cost-insights/infra/lambda:/app
#     working_dir: /app
#     command: python app.py

#   dashboard:
#     build: ./cloud-cost-insights/dashboard
#     ports:
#       - "8501:8501"
#     command: streamlit run streamlit_app.py

#   cli:
#     build: ./cloud-dev-cli
#     volumes:
#       - ./cloud-dev-cli:/app
#     command: python cli.py
# ```

# Then just:

# ```bash
# docker compose up --build
# ```

# This is **the long-term dev experience** you’re building toward — and modular venvs make it possible.

# ---

# ### Option 3: 🔀 Use `Makefile` in Root

# You can build a cross-project dev experience:

# ```makefile
# setup:
# 	cd cloud-cost-insights/infra/lambda && python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

# test-lambda:
# 	cd cloud-cost-insights/infra/lambda && . .venv/bin/activate && python test_local.py

# run-dashboard:
# 	cd cloud-cost-insights/dashboard && . .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# ```

# Now everything is **modular under the hood**, but **easy from the top**.

# ---

# ## 🧠 TL;DR

# | Concern | Answer |
# |--------|--------|
# | Does modular = too isolated? | Not if you wrap it right |
# | Can I create one-click setup later? | ✅ Yes — via `setup.sh`, `Makefile`, or `docker-compose` |
# | Is this overkill now? | ❌ No — you're future-proofing while staying light |
# | Will future teammates or employers appreciate this? | ✅ Hell yes |

# ---

# ### ✅ You made the right choice now — and you’re 100% free to unify later.

# Want help writing a `setup.sh` or root `Makefile` when you're ready to streamline? Just say the word — we’ll make it dev-friendly 💡
